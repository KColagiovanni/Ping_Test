# Check Network Devices

## Description
This is a simple program that will check either all IP addresses on your network, or a
list of specific devices. The program can be configured a few different ways. It can show
all IP addresses on a defined network or it can show a predefined list of newwork devices.
It can also be configured to shoe only devices that are online, or both online and offline. 
If displaying all IP addresses, it will show the status "online" or "offline", the latency 
(time from the machine running the program to the router to the device), and the IP address 
of the device. If displaying a list of predefined known devices, it will show everthing 
previously mentioned, in addition to the device name.
